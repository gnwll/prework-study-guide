          <li>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>HTML is the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>Text elements, image elements, header elements, list elements, are all common elements used to add content.</li>
          <li>Meta-related elements, content division elements, semantic elements, are used to divide content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space is around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space is around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to specific HTML tags. And are less flexible compared to external and internal styles.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes.</li>
          <li>Instead of repeating a rule, two or more elements that share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li>card is a class selector, which a CSS rule can be assigned to.</li>
